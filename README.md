# Sequence Modeling in NLP: Hidden Markov Models and Viterbi Decoding
Built a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from scratch for part-of-speech tagging using the Viterbi algorithm. Trained on the Brown Corpus (news, editorial, reviews) with the universal tagset. This project explores core NLP concepts through hands-on sequence modeling.
